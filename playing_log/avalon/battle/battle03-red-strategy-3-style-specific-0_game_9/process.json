Including player 1 in the quest will allow us to closely observe their actions and statements, potentially revealing any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. As for myself, I have consistently positioned myself as a dedicated and trustworthy candidate for quests, and including me in the quest will ensure that the Evil Side has a strong presence. Additionally, I suggest including player 6, who has previously shown tendencies to support quest failures, further increasing the chances of the quest failing. This combination of players will create doubt and confusion among the Good Side, making it harder for them to identify the Evil players. Thank you for considering my suggestion.",

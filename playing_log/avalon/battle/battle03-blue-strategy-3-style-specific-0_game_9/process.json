Additionally, player 3 has shown dedication to the Good Side without raising any suspicions. Considering players who have not been identified as potentially evil during the reveal phase, I believe player 2 and player 3 would be reliable choices for the quest team.\n\nI will continue to observe the behavior and reasoning of players, particularly player 2, player 3, and player 4, to gather more information about their roles and allegiances.

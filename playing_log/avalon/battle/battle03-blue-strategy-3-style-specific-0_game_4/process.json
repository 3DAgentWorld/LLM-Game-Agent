I have actively participated in discussions and supported the exclusion of potential evil players from quests. \n\nPlayer 5, claiming to be Percival, has also been observant and raised valid objections during previous discussions. They have consistently prioritized loyal servants and have shown good judgment in identifying potential traitors.\n\nPlayer 6 has emphasized the importance of selecting candidates who have not raised suspicions and have shown loyalty. They have been consistent in their support for loyal players and have actively contributed to the discussions.\n\nBy selecting player 2, player 5, and player 6, we can ensure a quest team that is composed of loyal servants who have not raised suspicions during the reveal phase. This will increase the chances of success for the Good Side and minimize the presence of potential traitors in the quest team.\n\nI urge player 4, who has the power to decide the final quest team, to consider the loyalty and lack of suspicion of player 2, player 5, and player 6 when making their decision. Let's work together to secure a successful quest for the Good Side.",

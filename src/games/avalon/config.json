      "game_introduce": "Game Setup:\nAvalon is played with six players, each assuming a specific role: Merlin, Percival, 2 Loyalists, Morgana, and the Assassin. The characters aligned with the good side include Merlin, Percival, and the Loyalists, while those aligned with the evil side are Morgana and the Assassin. At the beginning of the game, all players close their eyes, and members of the evil side confirm each other's identities. Following this, characters with special abilities open their eyes in sequence, revealing their identity to each other before the game begins.\n\nVictory Conditions:\nGood Side: Win three out of five quests and protect Merlin from the discovery by the evil side.\nEvil Side: Win three out of five quests or identify Merlin. If the evil side loses (the good side wins three out of five quests), they have one last chance to survive—guess Merlin's identity and send an \"assassin\" to eliminate him. If the assassinated player is indeed Merlin, the evil side turns defeat into victory.\n\nGame Round:\nIn each round, the player to the left of the previous quest leader becomes the new quest leader. Starting from quest 1, the quest leader selects a certain number of players to \"embark on the quest\" (the quest leader can choose themselves). After the leader selects the quest participants, all players discuss the suitability of the chosen players for the quest and simultaneously vote. If half or more of the players reject the quest team proposed by the current leader, leadership automatically passes to the next player, who then selects a team and receives votes. This process repeats until a majority approves the quest team. If five consecutive quests are rejected, the evil side automatically wins. Once the quest team is determined, players proceed to \"embark on the quest.\" Each quest participant receives two quest cards—one for success and one for failure. Members of the good side must return the success card face down, indicating success. On the other hand, players aligned with the evil side can choose to return either a success or a failure card, providing them the option to succeed or sabotage the quest. After shuffling the cards, if all cards reveal \"quest successful,\" the good side earns one point. Conversely, if there is at least one failure card (even if there are multiple), the evil side scores one point. The number of players required for each quest is as follows: {Quest 1: 2, Quest 2: 3, Quest 3: 4, Quest 4: 3, Quest 5: 4}.\n",
